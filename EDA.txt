those who churned used to charge more than those who don't. This is obvious because we have seen previously that 
there is a tendency to opt for fiber optics. As we may know, fiber optics is more expensive than DSL. 


What is customer churn ?
if a customer signed up for Fiber optic, not SeniorCitizen, seems to not be interessted to additional internet service, 
with tenure about less than 12 and on month-to-month contract there is more chance that he is going to churn.
